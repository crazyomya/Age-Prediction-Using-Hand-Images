# Age-Prediction-Using-Hand-Images
The project proposes a model for the prediction of the age group of human beings using images of their hands. 
It involves extracting features from images and using them to predict the age group. 
Age prediction using images of hands turns out to be a beneficial method as it helps us predict the age group it belongs to without even seeing the facial features.
Three age groups, young, adult, and old, are considered for the classification model. It is based on studying the texture-based features of images of hands and clustering them. T
he paper covers a variety of feature extraction techniques and classifying algorithms to get results with very high accuracy. It can be viewed as a comparative study of methods for age prediction using images of hands. 
Five different classifiers are used to compare the accuracy and choose the best case. The model gives satisfying results with high precision and accuracy
