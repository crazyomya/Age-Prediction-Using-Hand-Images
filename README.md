# Age Prediction Using Hand Images

This project introduces a novel method for predicting human age groups by analyzing images of hands. By extracting distinct features from hand images, it enables accurate age group classification, even without facial data. The model classifies individuals into three age groups: young, adult, and old, based on texture-based features from hand images.

## Key Features

- Utilizes texture-based features for age prediction from hand images.
- Implements clustering techniques to classify age groups effectively.
- Explores various feature extraction methods and classification algorithms for high-accuracy results.
- Compares the performance of five different classifiers to identify the most accurate approach.
- Achieves satisfying results with a focus on precision and accuracy.

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of age prediction using hand images, offering valuable insights into the effectiveness of different methodologies.
